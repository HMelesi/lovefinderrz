# Lovefinderrz Mobile App

## About

Lovefinderrz was created as a first project while learning to use React Native. If you're a fan of Rick and Morty the concept will need no explanation, but for those who are not it is a **dating app**.

This project uses **React Native**, **React Navigation** and **React Context** to allow users to navigate through the app and both add and remove matches from their profile. This project is front end only, and uses hard-coded data, which can be refreshed by pressing the _WIPE ALL DATA_ button on the welcome screen after logging out.

## User Stories

Users can:

- Choose which character they want to be from the Smith household.
- Be presented with potential suitor one by one, and choose whether to **message**, **match** or **reject** them (_messaging also matches the suitor_).
- See a **list of matches** by pressing the top-left heart.
- See a character profile by pressing on the character from the list.
- Choose later to either message or unmatch with a character.
- Type and **send messages to characters**, and randomly receive responses from the characters.
- View their own profile and logout.
