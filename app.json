    "description": "Lovefinderrz was created as a first project while learning to use React Native. If you're a fan of Rick and Morty the concept will need no explanation, but for those who are not it is a dating app. This project uses React Native, React Navigation and React Context to allow users to navigate through the app and both add and remove matches from their profile. This project is front end only, and uses hard-coded data, which can be refreshed by pressing the WIPE ALL DATA button on the welcome screen after logging out.",
